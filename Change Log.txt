Rise From The Ashes 0.1

Rise From The Ashes is an overhaul modification for the popular survival game, 7 Days to Die, 
designed to infuse the gameplay experience with the depth and richness characteristic of traditional RPGs.

Upon embarking on their journey, players are prompted to define their character's backstory by selecting one profession and two hobbies from their pre-apocalypse life. 
This choice not only imbues the character with a sense of identity but also influences their starting skills and abilities, setting the stage for a personalized gameplay experience.

Central is the integration of a stats framework comprising attributes such as Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Fortitude, Dexterity, and Charisma. 
These attributes play a pivotal role in affecting everything from combat prowess to crafting proficiency and social interactions.

As players venture forth into the desolate landscape, they will find that skill development is not a static process but rather a dynamic journey of growth and improvement. 
Skills are honed through practical experience, with proficiency increasing as players engage in various activities such as combat, crafting, and resource gathering.
Moreover, players can augment their skill progression by acquiring and studying skill magazines or conducting research to uncover new crafting recipes and techniques.

Crafting, a cornerstone of survival in the harsh post-apocalyptic world, follows a structured tiered system, ranging from Tier 1 to Tier 6. 
Recipes for crafting items are designed to correspond with the tier level, with more advanced items requiring increasingly rare and valuable resources. 
As players invest time and effort into honing their crafting skills, they unlock access to a wider array of crafting options, empowering them to create powerful weapons, 
fortifications, and survival gear.

The economic ecosystem is sustained by the presence of traders, who serve as both vendors for essential resources and buyers for crafted goods. 
Players can earn valuable currency known as dukes by crafting and selling their wares to traders, thereby facilitating the acquisition of crucial supplies and equipment necessary for survival.
This mod makes dukes a much needed resource as traders now sell more items that are needed for progression. Those who specialize will want to sell their goods and buy
the items they can't make for themselves. Becoming a master of any single skill is time consuming and becoming a master of them all will be a daunting task. Unless you're 
on a multiplayer game, you will need the trader to progress at a reasonable rate.

(Multiplayer)
Beyond the solitary struggle for survival, the mod encourages players to engage with the broader community of survivors scattered across the wasteland. By leveraging their 
specialized skills and resources, players can forge alliances, barter for goods, and collaborate on ambitious endeavors.
